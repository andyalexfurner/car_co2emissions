# CO2 Emissions of a Car Predicted using Regression
One of the first projects I did when I started learning Data Science / Machine Learning (hence the not so good accuracy).

The model has also been implemented in a webapp using Streamlit where you can give the input as features of a car such as engine size, cylinders and fuel consumption which then returns the Co2 Emission(g/km).
